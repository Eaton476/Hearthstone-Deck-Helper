# Hearthstone Assistant
This application was developed as a deliverable for my disseration towards my Software Engineering degree at Sheffield Hallam University. I obtained a First Class (Honours) accreditation as a result of this work.

This application aims to watch you play the popular CCG Hearthstone developed by Blizzard, collect all the information it can from your gameplay and then use that data to analyse your performance and suggest new ways that you can improve your game.

It is written in C# and uses WCF as the UI framework to display the application to the user.
